# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
        - Conditionals are useful in order to determine if user input matches the desired answer in order to continue engaging with content. For example, if trying to make a recipe (like pizza!) without enough ingredients, we wouldn't be able to proceed with the recipe. If users are trying to enter a brewery's site without indicating that they're 21 or over, they won't be able continue using the site. 
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
        - I would have remembered that all Ruby commands are case sensitive, and wouldn't have had to spend so much time wondering why I kept getting a syntax error with code that started with "If..." :laugh:
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
        - This was a really enjoyable, tangible lesson for me! It felt like I was actually coding, or actually creating things that might be useful for others to engage in. It was the first lesson where I wanted to share what I was learning with my family :smile:
